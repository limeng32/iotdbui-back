# IoTDB-UI

IoTDB-UI is a management system that can deeply manage IoTDB. It provides precise management at the desktop software level. I hope it will be helpful for you when using IoTDB.

#### Required

Java 1.8 or above

Maven 3.3.0 or above

Nginx

#### Deployment steps

1.In the project root directory execute `mvn clean package` to compile

2.Make sure the sqlite file `iotdbui.db` exists in the project root directory. If you use another database, you need to modify the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file

3.Deploy using docker-compose (require docker and docker-compose):

- In the project root directory execute `docker-compose up`

4.Deploy using traditional way:

- In the project root directory execute `java -jar target/iotdb-ui-0.12.3.jar` to startup, 8080 port is used by default

- Map the contents in `/front/dist` or the front-end project compiled by yourself to a port through nginx. For example, the following configuration maps the application to port 8040:

```
server {
	listen		8040;
	server_name	localhost;
	location / {
		root	iotdbui-back/front/dist;
		index	index.html;
	}
	location /api/ {
           proxy_pass    http://localhost:8080/api/;
        }
}
```

- If you enable the websocket feature on nginx, you can get a better user experience. If you do not enable it, it will not affect the use at all;

5.Now use your browser to open the port you previously set (for example http://localhost:8040/ ï¼‰, start to enjoy iotdb!
